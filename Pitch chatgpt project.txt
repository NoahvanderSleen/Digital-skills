Pitch chatgpt project

For the project I think it would be fun to make a horror game with chatgpt. It would probably be really bad which would be very funny but after each time I add something I won't know what to expect, like a jumpscare or something so it would be scary which is funny. I can also maybe make my classmates play it which is also funny. It's really just perfect for chatgpt. I'm gonna try to make it on a website first.
